# Pig-farm
For those downloading the actual code:
External libraries:
  pygame
All other libraries are native to python

This is created/maintained on my (Woldorf) own free-time so  if issues dont get resolved quickly it's becuase I have a life and job, this is just a side hobby
Any concerns, complaints, issues, or weird comments, just reach out to me through the Issues tab

This game is kind of similar to any "this eats that" game such as hole.io, pig eats until it reachers a max size then goes to the base to continue or quit
More features to come as I work on it. The Research tab on the start screen is not currently fully functional, I'm workin on it I swear

Check out other games made by me as well, all on Github
